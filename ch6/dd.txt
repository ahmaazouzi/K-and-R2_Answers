It is the de facto substandard of programming languages.
    C runs on everything.
    C lets you write programs that use very few resources.
    C gives you near-total control over the system, down to the level of pushing around individual bits with your bare hands.
    C imposes very few constraints on programming style: unlike higher-level languages, C doesn't have much of an ideology. There are very few programs you can't write in C.
    Many of the programming languages people actually use (Visual Basic, perl, python, ruby, PHP, etc.) are executed by interpreters written in C (or C++, an extension to C).
You will learn discipline.
    C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot.
    You can learn to avoid this by being careful about where you point it.
    Pain is a powerful teacher of caution.
You will fail CPSC 323 if you don't learn C really well in CPSC 223 (CS majors only).
