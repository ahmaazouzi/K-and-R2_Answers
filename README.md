Solutions to the exercises from The C Programming Language By Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan (K&amp;R C)

I've attempted solving most of the exercises as much as I could. Where the questions were vague, I took the liberty to overassume.
I skipped a few questions I thought were too vague or I just did't undertstand and thought were hard. 
I also skipped chapter 8, except for one exercise, as my knowledge of OS stuff is seriously lacking. I am planning to come back to it after familiarizing myself with that arcania (for me, it's a terra incognita at the moment).
